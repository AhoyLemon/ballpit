#ballp.it
####(where hardons collide)

This is the working repo for everything that's happening on [ballp.it](http://ballp.it), the user forum for [The F Plus](http://thefpl.us).

The forum is built using [Simple Machines](http://simplemachines.org/), and most of the development work is just in the forum theme. The theme for ballp.it is based off [Giggle](http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?topic=492107.0), a Googlesque SMF theme, but has been modified considerably. 

If anything in this repo helps you with your Simple Machines Forum, then *hooray*!
